# Splunk APM: Span Attributes 101

Goals:

* Demonstrate OpenTelemetry span enrichment capabilities using span attributes
* Review OpenTelemetry span attribute code examples in a Java based micro-service application
* Demonstrate Splunk APM's ability to use span tags to filter
* Demonstrate Splunk APM's ability to use a tag to search for an individual or group of transactions.

In OpenTelemetry an [attribute](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/common/common.md#attributes) is a key-value pair which can be utilized to enrich a span. The attribute key must be a non-null, non-empty string. The attribute value can be either a primitive type (string, boolean, double precision floating point (IEEE 754-1985) or signed 64 bit integer.) or an array of homogenous primitive types, meaning the array must not contain values of different types.

There are a number of span attributes that are collected by default via auto-instrumentation. These vary by language and framework but are typically well-known (e.g. http.status_code). Additionally, when using the [Splunk distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector) or the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent) to collect traces, additional environment context is added the spans automatically (i.e. host, kubernetes_pod_name, os.description) enabling corelation with other sources such as infrastructure. 

Utilizing custom span attributes enable developers to include context that is specific to the application, service, environment, transaction, et cetera. 

Because Splunk APM is collecting, analyzing, and retaining :100: 100% :100: of the traces, span attributes can be used to filter, group, and search for specific transactions. A few examples of custom attributes include usernames, product or transaction IDs, application/service versions, and so-on. 

**TL;DR** Span attributes enrich application traces with valuable context about the discrete transaction they are associated with. Because Splunk APM is collecting, analyzing, and retaining :100: 100% :100: of the traces, these attributes can be used to filter, group, and search for individual or groups of transactions significantly increasing troubleshooting efficiency. 

In this overview we will:
1. Review how to add custom attributes to spans in a Java application
2. Deploy a micro-service application via Docker Compose
3. Execute transactions against the applications and observe slowness
4. Use Splunk APM and the custom attributes to identify the root cause of the slowness.
5. Use Splunk APM to search for a specific transaction using a span attribute.

## Prerequisites:
Please ensure you have a Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring and APM environment. To make the overview as simple as possible we will be using prebuilt docker images deployed with docker-compose. If you would like to modify the code you will have to build new docker images that can be run locally or pushed to a repo of your choosing. 

## 1: Review Span Attributes Code

For most users, the out-of-the-box Auto-instrumentation is completely sufficient and nothing more has to be done. Sometimes, however, users wish to add attributes to the otherwise automatic spans. A common need is to capture additional application-specific or business-specific information as additional attributes to an existing span from the automatic instrumentation.

Here we will review different ways span attributes can be captured. All examples referenced are from the ```HomeController``` class within the ```shop``` service.

The first example covers manual instrumentation. First, a Tracer must be acquired, which is responsible for creating spans and interacting with the Context. A tracer is acquired by using the OpenTelemetry API specifying the name and version of the library instrumenting the instrumented library or application to be monitored. Important: the "name" and optional version of the tracer are purely informational. All Tracers that are created by a single OpenTelemetry instance will interoperate, regardless of name.

```java
// Instantiate a Tracer object 
private static final Tracer s_tracer =
		GlobalOpenTelemetry.getTracer("shop.tracer");
```

Next, create a basic span, you only need to specify the name of the span. The start and end time of the span is automatically set by the OpenTelemetry SDK. In this example the span name is ```getProductController```.

Here is where we define the first two custom attributes: ```store.location``` and ```product.category```. Since this is an example of manual instrumentation the span must be put into current context. the ```span.setAttribute()``` method is used. This method takes two parameters, a key and a value, which are used to define the attribute name and attribute value respectively. In this case we set the attribute name using a string, and use getter methods to set the value.

```java
@PostMapping("/getProducts")
public String getProducts(@ModelAttribute Store store, Model model) {
    	 
    // Create Span
    Span span = s_tracer.spanBuilder("getProductsController").startSpan();
    // Put the span into the current Context
    try (Scope scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
	     
        // Set custom store.location and product.category attributes 
	span.setAttribute("store.location",store.getLocation());
	span.setAttribute("product.category", store.getCategory());
        
        //  Do some work
	model.addAttribute("products", productService.getProductsByCategory(loadBalanceAPIVersion(true), store.getCategory()));
        model.addAttribute("traceId", APM_URL + Span.current().getSpanContext().getTraceIdAsHexString());
		    
	} finally { 
	    span.end(); // End the span 
	}
    	
    return "index";
}
```
Here is the resulting trace with the ```getProductsController``` span expanded. Note the span attributes ```store.location``` and ```product.category``` attributes.

![getProductController](/images/getProducts.png)

Another common situation is to capture a span corresponding to one of your methods. The ```@WithSpan``` annotation makes this straightforward. Each time the application invokes the annotated method, it creates a span that denotes its duration and provides any thrown exceptions. Unless specified as an argument to the annotation, the span name will be ```<className>.<methodName>```. In this example the span will be named ```HomeController.loadBalanceAPIVersion```. 

To add span attributes, we must first access the current span using the Span interface provided by OpenTelemetry. Just like before we can add span attributes using the ```span.setAttribute``` method. Here we are also adding a span event. An event is a human-readable message on a span that represents “something happening” during it’s lifetime. A useful characteristic of events is that their timestamps are displayed as offsets from the beginning of the span, allowing you to easily see how much time elapsed between them.

```java
@WithSpan //Use the @WithSpan annotation to automatically instrument the method. 
public String loadBalanceAPIVersion(Boolean loadbalance) {
	
	// Put the span into the current Context
	Span span = Span.current();
	
	String apiVersion;
    
	// Do some work
	if (loadbalance){
		Random pickapi = new Random();
		if(pickapi.nextBoolean()){
		    apiVersion = "v1";
			} else apiVersion = "v2";
		} else apiVersion = "v2";
        
    //Set a custom attribute and event 
    span.setAttribute("api.version", apiVersion);
    span.addEvent("Our Crystal Ball Chose API Version: " + apiVersion);

    return apiVersion;
}

```

Here is the resulting trace with the ```HomeController.loadBalanceAPIVersion``` span expanded. Note the span attributes ```api.version``` attribute and the event.

## 2: Deploy Buttercup Games Inventory Application :horse:

The pre-packaged Buttercup Games Inventory Application is designed to send emitted traces directly to the Splunk APM backend so no Smart Agent or OpenTelemetry Collector is needed.

There are three variables that must be included. They can be passed directly into the startup command or exported as environment variables.
| Config Option | Description |
| --------------| ------------|
| SFX_REALM | Specify the name of the realm in which your organization is hosted |
| SFX_TOKEN | Access Token from SIM/APM Org |
| USERNAME  | Value appended to the ```environment``` attribute - used to identify services in Splunk APM |  

From the root directory of the project run:

```
SFX_REALM=${SFX_REALM} SFX_TOKEN=${SFX_TOKEN} USERNAME=${USERNAME} docker-compose up -d 
```

If everything is successful, you should receive the following output:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
Starting javashop-otel_products_1 ... done
Starting javashop-otel_stock_1    ... done
Recreating javashop-otel_shop_1   ... done
```

## 3: Execute Transactions
The ```shop``` service is the entrypoint for the Buttercup Games Inventory application. This service exposes port ```8010```. You can access the application from your favorite browser at: 
```
http://localhost:8010
``` 
From the home page enter any value in the ```Store Location``` field, chose a ```Category```, and hit ```Submit```. You can do this as many times as you would like. Each time the submit button is hit, a new trace will be generated.

The values used for ```Store Location``` and ```Category``` will be the values that are applied to the custom attributes ```store.location``` and ```product.category``` respectively.

![Tag Spotlight](/images/homescreen.png)

You should notice about half of the time when clicking the submit button the application will hang for few seconds. This is user experience is unacceptable so next we will investigate the problem using Splunk APM.

## 4: Troubleshoot Slow Transactions with Splunk APM

Within SIM & APM navigate to the Troubleshooting view on the APM tab. Filter the traces down to the transaction that were executed in the previous step by selecting ```shop:/getProducts``` from the Workflow dropdown.

![Buttercup Service Overview](/images/buttercup_service_overview.png)

Right away you should notice the high latency between the ```External Client```, ```shop```, and ```products``` services. 

With the ```shop``` service selected apply the ```store.location``` and ```product.category``` as a breakdown. This allows you view the service topology using the custom attributes. Notice that all of the locations and categories are impacted by the high latency issue. We have immediately identified that the issue is impacting all stores and products so the fault domain must be somewhere else. 

Breakdown using ```store.location```
![Store Location Breakdown](/images/store_location_breakdown.png)

Breakdown using ```product.category```
![Product Category Breakdown](/images/product_category_breakdown.png)

Now breakdown the ```shop``` service by the ```api.version``` attribute.  

![API Version Breakdown](/images/api_version_breakdown.png)

Alas! It appears we have found the issue! All of the transactions that are using the ```v1``` version of the API are experiencing extremely high latency. We can further corroborate this by applying the ```Endpoint``` breakdown to the ```product``` service. ```Endpoint``` is an example of a default span attribute which Splunk collects automatically. Every transaction hitting the ```/api/v1``` endpoint of the ```product``` service is experiencing really high latency. 

We could have identified the bottleneck even faster using the Tag Spotlight view which gives a breakdown of all the tags for a given service broken out by failure rate and latency. Notice the difference in response time between the API versions.

## 5: Search for Individual Transactions with Splunk APM
We've already seen a few examples of how Splunk APM can utilize both default and custom attributes to filter and group services streamlining the troubleshooting process by providing much needed critical context on a per-trace basis. But we can take that a step further.

Because Splunk APM is collecting, analyzing, and retaining :100: 100% :100: of the traces, we can use those attributes to search for an individual or group of transactions.  

Here we will cover two examples of searching for a specific transaction:
* Using a span attribute value
* Using the traceId

From the Troubleshooting view on the APM tab, select the ```Tags``` field across the top. Select the ```store.location``` attribute. The fields will update to the values that are available for this attribute. You can select from the populated list, or begin typing to filter the list down to the selection of your choice. Once selected the service map will update to only include the traces that contain the value you selected. 

![Tag Filter](/images/tag_filter.png)

In the bottom right corner select ```Show Traces``` to view the individual transactions associated with the attribute you have filtered to.

![Filtered Traces](/images/filtered_traces.png)

It is a common practice to inject the Trace ID into application logs or exceptions. We can use the Trace ID to search for a specific individual transaction. Traces to be shard amongst teams, attached to support cases, or other troubleshooting exercises. This can be done by entering the trace into the View Trace ID search bar from the Splunk APM ```Show Traces``` page or by passing the Trace ID into the Splunk APM Trace URL ```https://app.${SFX_REALM}.signalfx.com/#/apm/traces/${traceID}``` (Note the SFX_REALM).

![View Trace Search Bar](/images/view_trace.png)

At the bottom of the Buttercup Games Inventory Application the Trace ID for each transaction will be displayed, there is also a link allowing you to directly view the individual trace. Note it can take a minute for the trace to be searchable in Splunk APM.
